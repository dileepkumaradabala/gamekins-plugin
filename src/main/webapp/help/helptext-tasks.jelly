    <ul>
        <li>The current challenges table displays the current Challenges you can solve</li>
        <li>All necessary information about the Challenge like <i>class</i>, <i>package</i> or <i>branch</i>
            can be found in the description of the Challenge
        </li>
        <li>There are seven types of Challenges:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Build Challenge</b>: Generated after a build failed because of your commit. Fix the build
                to solve the Challenge
            </li>
            <li><b>Test Challenge</b>: Just write a new test without specific requirements
            </li>
            <li><b>Class Coverage Challenge</b>: Cover more lines in a specific class. It does not matter
                which lines
            </li>
            <li><b>Method Coverage Challenge</b>: Cover more lines in a specific method. It does not matter
                which lines
            </li>
            <li><b>Line Coverage Challenge</b>: Cover the specified line or at least one more branch if
                available
            </li>
            <li><b>Mutation Test Challenge</b>: Write a test or improve an existing one to kill the
                generated mutant.
            </li>
            <li><b>Smell Challenge</b>: Remove a code or test smell.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Click on a <b>Challenge</b> to get the content and more details,</li>
        <li>The <i>branch</i> information states in which branch the Challenges was generated</li>
        <li>Challenges can also be solved in other branches if the mentioned code is available</li>
        <li>Challenges are only generated and solved during the <i>run/build</i> of a project/job in Jenkins
        </li>
        <li>Normally, the build is triggered after each commit or after a specific amount of time. If you
            don't want to wait, you can start the build manually by clicking <b>Build Now</b> in the left
            panel
        </li>
        <li>If the Challenge cannot be solved for some reason or the class/method under test should not be
            tested, the Challenges can be rejected
        </li>
        <li>To reject a Challenge, click the <b>Reject</b> button on each Challenge and add a reason, why the
            Challenge was rejected
        </li>
        <li>Challenges may be rejected automatically if they are not solvable anymore</li>
        <li>Rejected Challenges won't appear to be generated a second time</li>
        <li>After rejection a new Challenge is generated if the code of the project is available</li>
        <li>Hover over a rejected Challenge to see the reason for rejection</li>

        <li>If a Class Coverage Challenge is rejected, the whole <i>class</i> is not considered again
            for new Challenges
        </li>
        <li>Rejected Class Coverage Challenges can be restored with the <b>Undo</b>-Button next to
            the Challenge
        </li>
        <li>The Challenge will not be immediately active again, it has to be generated again to appear</li>

        <li>To store a Challenge, click the store button</li>
        <li>Stored Challenges cannot be completed and will count as rejected should they be solved</li>
        <li>To view, unshelve and send stored Challenges press the Stored Challenges Button</li>
        <li>Stored Challenges can be sent to another participant if that option is enabled</li>

        <li>If there are no Challenges generated for you, although you have committed something recently,
            then check the <b>Git Names</b> in your profile settings
        </li>
        <li>In addition to Challenges, <b>Quests</b> are generated and can be solved step by step,
            since they consist of different Challenges. The Challenges of a quest must be solved
            in the given order
        </li>

        <li>Also have a look at the <b>Achievements</b> available in your profile. You can access them
            by clicking on the link of your name in the Leaderboard. Remember to choose the right project
            in the dropdown in your profile.
        </li>
        <li>You can also view the Achievements of other players by clicking on their name in the leaderboard
        </li>

        <li>The <b>Avatar</b> displayed in the leaderboard can be changed in your profile settings.
            There are 50 different avatars you can choose from
        </li>
        <li>When a build for example solves a Challenge or generates a new one, notifications are sent to
            the given email address. You can disable this option in your profile settings
        </li>
    </ul>
